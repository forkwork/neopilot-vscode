# Neopilot on Windows

Neopilot is not supported on Windows (yet). We have limited developer bandwidth, and a
new platform is a large undertaking. However, the community has developed
a build of Neopilot on Windows, and you can compile it yourself with these instructions:

- [Building for Windows](./development/windows.md)

We are currently hiring a [Windows Lead](https://neopilot.dev/jobs/windows-lead).

For now, we welcome contributions from the community to improve Windows support.
